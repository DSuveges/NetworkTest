## NetworkTest

This small project was motivated by the recent problems with our internet access. The problem was definitely with the ISP (BT): at the time when the service was down, BT's free wi-fi network was also unreachable. These outages occurs randomly and the length were greatly varying from less than a minute to half hour. This is a extremely anoying behavior and I have decided to monitor the our internet service for a few days so I can enforce my complaints with measured data.

### Approach

I have written a small Perl script that was pingin google.com every 6 seconds by sending a single package. The exit code of ping was captured by the script, and was saved with the actual data/time in a user specified output file. The script was run in our local NAS continously for 4 days.

This file was then read by a Python script and analyzed for outages occured during the tested period, and some summaries and plot was generated.

### Results

Indeed, the quality of the service was unacceptably poor in the beginning of the tested period, with very frequent outages. LAter the situation become better, but there are problems still.

Red line shows the exit code of ping. Exit code 0 indicates successfull package exchange, exit code 1 indicate failed package transfer.

During the observed period (2016.Feb.02-06), we experienced 91 outages in the internet service lasting altogether
162.0 minutes. The average outage lasted for 106.81 seconds while the median length of the outages was 92.0.
